I am looking for research students to work with me. The student can choose to do research on one of the following three paths.

- **Purely Theoretical**:
    - *Research topics*: Hardness of Approximation and PCPs, Property Testing, Streaming Algorithms (or Big Data algorithms in general), Computational Learning Theory. 
    - *Qualifications*: The student is expected to have done very well in algorithms, datastructures, basic math courses. 

\

- **Theory + Applied**:
    - *Research Topics*: Interpretable/Explanable AI, Graph/Information theoretic approaches to analysing Neural Networks or Big Data in general. 
    - *Qualifications*: Students applying are expected to have good programming experience in numpy, deep learning frameworks etc in addition to the requirements for purely theoretical above

\

- **Purely Applied**:
    - *Research Topics*: Building Scene Understanding Pipeline for Autonomous Navigation on Rasberri Pi or Android devices, Performance Bechmarks for Deep Learning on Rasberri Pi/Android/IoT processors.
    - *Qualifications*: Students should have experience with Rasberry Pi, Android programming as well as Deep Learning Frame works.



## Internships

I am looking for long term interns in the following 3 groupings:

- **2-4 months**: Since the time period is short, the student is expected to be well qualified in the particular topic. Also this has typically the largest pool of applicants. 
- **5-8 months**: 
- **9-12 months**:

Students can choose to have:

- *No Support/No Campus Accomodation*: The student is expected to find his/her own accomodation and no financial support will be provided. The student is expected to be in the office at IIITH, during 10-5, for 6 days a week. Applicants for <= 4 months are only considered in this category. Exceptions could be made for extremely good candidates.
- *No Support but with Campus Accomodation*: Campus accomodation in shared hostel rooms will be arranged. However students will need to pay for the expenses (approx 6K per month). I will try to arrange this for students coming for *5-9 months*. If you do not require it, then you have higher chance for the internship.
- *Support with Campus Accomodation*: I will support the living expenses with campus accomodation for students staying *>=10 months*.
