## Prerequisites
Assumes basic knowledge of Discrete Maths, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Algorithms. Highly recomended to brush up these concepts. Some references are given bellow:

- Mathematical Background, Intro. to TCS, Boaz Barak.
  https://files.boazbarak.org/introtcs/lnotes_book.pdf  
  We will be assuming that you have read this chapter fully and will have an assignment based on it in the first week.
    
- Mathematics for Computer Science. MIT OCW course.  
  https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/resource-index/  
  This is a good long reference. You can brush topics selectively based on need.
