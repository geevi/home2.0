A first undergraduate course in probability and statistics with a focus on discrete spaces. The course is roughly divided in to 4 equal parts with an exam at the end of each part.


## Grading
- Weekly Assignments: 20%
  - 8 in total, 2 per quarter.
  - Deadlines at the begining of tutorials.
  - Questions based on assignments will be asked to random student during tutorials. So make sure you understand your solutions.

- Quiz 1, Quiz 2: 10% each
  - Weight: 10% each

- MidSem: 25%

- EndSem: 35%

- Bonus Marks: 5%
  - For questions based on Bonus Topics

## How to ace the course with minimum effort?
1. *Attend* all the lectures (90 mins each).
2. *Read* the corresponding topics in the textbook on the same day (1 hr after each lecture).
3. *Solve* the problems for the previous lecture before the next lecture (2 hr after each lecture).
4. *Ask* doubts and clear them during tutorials (60 mins).
5. *Explore* bonus topics for fun and get bonus points.

So weekly there is 4 hrs of classroom time and 6 hrs of homework.

If you are lagging behind, use the online course material to catch up. There are also 1-2 buffer classes in each quarter, to help you. If you are already comfortable with the topics, the buffer classes gives you time to explore bonus topics.
