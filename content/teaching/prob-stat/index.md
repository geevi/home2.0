I am teaching a 17 lecture course on Probability here: [https://elearn.iiit.ac.in/courses/course-v1:IIITH+M20Temp4+2020_Monsoon/about](https://elearn.iiit.ac.in/courses/course-v1:IIITH+M20Temp4+2020_Monsoon/about). Videos from that course available on youtube:

A first undergraduate course in probability and statistics with a focus on discrete spaces. The course is roughly divided in to 4 equal parts with an exam at the end of each part.


## Grading
- Assignment Test: 20%
  - Practice problems are given at the end of each lecture.
  - There will be 2, 30 min tests per quarter (8 in total), based on the practice problems as well as OCW Recitations.
  - Tests will be for 3 marks each and the scores of best 6 out 8 will be used for grading.
  - 2 marks is allocated for solving some tricky problems that will be shared.

- Quiz 1, Quiz 2: 10% each
- MidSem: 25%
- EndSem: 35%
- Bonus Marks: 5% (For questions based on Bonus Topics).

## How to ace the course with minimum effort?

1. *Attend* all the lectures (90 mins each).
2. *Read* the corresponding topics in the textbook on the same day (1 hr after each lecture).
3. *Solve* the problems for the previous lecture before the next lecture (2 hr after each lecture).
4. *Ask* doubts and clear them during tutorials (60 mins).
5. *Explore* bonus topics for fun and get bonus points.

So weekly there is 4 hrs of classroom time and 6 hrs of homework.

If you are lagging behind, use the online course material [OCW] to catch up. There are also 1-2 buffer classes in each quarter, to help you. If you are already comfortable with the topics, the buffer classes gives you time to explore bonus topics.
