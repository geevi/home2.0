      <description>Visual place recognition on low memory devices such as mobile phones and robotics systems is a challenging problem. The state of the art models for this task uses deep learning architectures having close to 100 million parameters which takes over 400MB of memory. This makes these models infeasible to be deployed in low memory devices and gives rise to the need of compressing them. Hence we study the effectiveness of model compression techniques like trained quantization and pruning for reducing the number of parameters on one of the best performing image retrieval models called NetVLAD.</description>
