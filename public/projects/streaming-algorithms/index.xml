      <description>We study the complexity of the following problems in the streaming model. Membership testing for DLIN We show that every language in DLIN can be recognised by a randomized one-pass O(logn) space algorithm with inverse polynomial one-sided error, and by a deterministic p-pass O(n/p) space algorithm. We show that these algorithms are optimal.Membership testing for LL(k). For languages generated by LL(k) grammars with a bound of r on the number of nonterminals at any stage in the left-most derivation, we show that membership can be tested by a randomized one-pass O(rlogn) space algorithm with inverse polynomial (in n) one-sided error.</description>
